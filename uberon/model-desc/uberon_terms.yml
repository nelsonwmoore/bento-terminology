    acetabular_part_of_hip_bone:
        Code: UBERON:0001269
        Definition: The acetabulum is a concave surface of the pelvis. The head of
            the femur meets with the pelvis at the acetabulum, forming the hip joint.
            There are three bones of the os coxae (hip bone) that come together to
            form the acetabulum. Contributing a little more than two-fifths of the
            structure is the ischium, which provides lower and side boundaries to
            the acetabulum. The ilium forms the upper boundary, providing a little
            less than two-fifths of the structure of the acetabulum. The rest is formed
            by the pubis, near the midline. It is bounded by a prominent uneven rim,
            which is thick and strong above, and serves for the attachment of the
            acetabular labrum, which reduces its opening, and deepens the surface
            for formation of the hip joint. At the lower part of the acetabulum is
            the acetabular notch, which is continuous with a circular depression,
            the acetabular fossa, at the bottom of the cavity of the acetabulum. The
            rest of the acetabulum is formed by a curved, crescent-moon shaped surface,
            the lunate surface, where the joint is made with the head of the femur.
            Its counterpart in the pectoral girdle is the glenoid fossa.

            to move freely without the walls of the uterus being too tight against
            its body. Buoyancy is also provided. The composition of the fluid changes
            over the course of gestation. Initially, amniotic fluid is similar to
            maternal plasma, mainly water with electrolytes. As the fetus develops,
            proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, phospholipids originating from the lungs,
            fetal cells, and urea are deposited in the fluid.

            Each gland opens into the lumen by a long duct which pierces the muscularis
            mucosae (Wilson and Washington, 1989). A sphincter is situated at the
            point where the esophagus enters the stomach to prevent gastro-esophageal
            reflux, i.e. to prevent acidic gastric contents from reaching stratified
            epithelia of the esophagus, where they can cause inflammation and irritation

            Definition: Mucosa arranged into two fundamental structures - villi and
                crypts of Lieberkuhn. Villi are projections into the lumen of the
                small intestine, covered with simple columnar epithelium. Crypts of
                Lieberkuhn are moat-like invaginations of the epithelium around the
                villi that extend through the lamina propria down to the muscularis
                mucosae. Lymphocytes often invade the epithelium or form solitary
                lymphoid nodules in the lamina propria. Lymph nodules may form longitudinal
                aggregations of 30-50 nodules in the lamina propria of the ileum.
                These large aggregations are called Peyer's patches. The muscularis
                mucosae has two layers and extends into the intestinal villi, where
                the smooth muscle cells form a longitudinal bundle in the centre of
                the villi. The small intestinal mucosa secretes gastrin, somatostatin,
                cholecystokinin and secretin.

            Definition: An organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is the
                shape of a fish and about the size of a hand. It is a compound gland
                composed of both exocrine and endocrine tissues. The endocrine pancreas
                makes insulin so that the body can use glucose (sugar) for energy.
                The exocrine pancreas makes enzymes that help the body digest food.
                Spread all over the pancreas are areas called the Islets of Langerhans.
                The cells in these areas each have a special purpose. The alpha cells
                make glucagon, which raises the level of glucose in the blood; the
                beta cells make insulin; the delta cells make somatostatin. There
                are also PP cells and D1 cells, about which little is known.

            Definition: The submandibular lymph nodes (submaxillary glands in older
                texts), three to six in number, are placed beneath the body of the
                mandible in the submaxillary triangle, and rest on the superficial
                surface of the submaxillary salivary gland. One gland, the middle
                gland of Stahr, which lies on the external maxillary artery as it
                turns over the mandible, is the most constant of the series; small
                lymph glands are sometimes found on the deep surface of the submaxillary
                salivary glands. The afferents of the submaxillary glands drain the
                medial palpebral commissure, the cheek, the side of the nose, the
                upper lip, the lateral part of the lower lip, the gums, and the anterior
                part of the margin of the tongue. Efferent vessels from the facial
                and submental glands also enter the submaxillary glands. Their efferent
                vessels pass to the superior deep cervical glands.

            (windpipe) and the esophagus. The hyoid bone and the clavicle are the

                It is located in the upper anterior portion of the chest, behind the
                sternum. It is composed predominantly of lymphocytes and fewer epithelial
                cells. Connective tissue septa separate the lobes into lobules. The
                lobules contain an outer portion (cortical zone) which is rich in
                lymphocytes and an inner portion (medullary zone) which is rich in
                epithelial cells. It is an organ essential for the development of
                the immune system. Its function is the maturation of the progenitor
                lymphoid cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells. It
                reaches its greatest weight at puberty and subsequently begins to
